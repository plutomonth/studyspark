/**
 * The high-level scheduling layer that implements stage-oriented scheduling. It computes a DAG of
 * stages for each job, keeps track of which RDDs and stage outputs are materialized, and finds a
 * minimal schedule to run the job. It then submits stages as TaskSets to an underlying
 * TaskScheduler implementation that runs them on the cluster. A TaskSet contains fully independent
 * tasks that can run right away based on the data that's already on the cluster (e.g. map output
 * files from previous stages), though it may fail if this data becomes unavailable.
 *
 * Spark stages are created by breaking the RDD graph at shuffle boundaries. RDD operations with
 * "narrow" dependencies, like map() and filter(), are pipelined together into one set of tasks
 * in each stage, but operations with shuffle dependencies require multiple stages (one to write a
 * set of map output files, and another to read those files after a barrier). In the end, every
 * stage will have only shuffle dependencies on other stages, and may compute multiple operations
 * inside it. The actual pipelining of these operations happens in the RDD.compute() functions of
 * various RDDs (MappedRDD, FilteredRDD, etc).
 *
 * In addition to coming up with a DAG of stages, the DAGScheduler also determines the preferred
 * locations to run each task on, based on the current cache status, and passes these to the
 * low-level TaskScheduler. Furthermore, it handles failures due to shuffle output files being
 * lost, in which case old stages may need to be resubmitted. Failures *within* a stage that are
 * not caused by shuffle file loss are handled by the TaskScheduler, which will retry each task
 * a small number of times before cancelling the whole stage.
 *
 * When looking through this code, there are several key concepts:
 *
 *  - Jobs (represented by [[ActiveJob]]) are the top-level work items submitted to the scheduler.
 *    For example, when the user calls an action, like count(), a job will be submitted through
 *    submitJob. Each Job may require the execution of multiple stages to build intermediate data.
 *
 *  - Stages ([[Stage]]) are sets of tasks that compute intermediate results in jobs, where each
 *    task computes the same function on partitions of the same RDD. Stages are separated at shuffle
 *    boundaries, which introduce a barrier (where we must wait for the previous stage to finish to
 *    fetch outputs). There are two types of stages: [[ResultStage]], for the final stage that
 *    executes an action, and [[ShuffleMapStage]], which writes map output files for a shuffle.
 *    Stages are often shared across multiple jobs, if these jobs reuse the same RDDs.
 *
 *  - Tasks are individual units of work, each sent to one machine.
 *
 *  - Cache tracking: the DAGScheduler figures out which RDDs are cached to avoid recomputing them
 *    and likewise remembers which shuffle map stages have already produced output files to avoid
 *    redoing the map side of a shuffle.
 *
 *  - Preferred locations: the DAGScheduler also computes where to run each task in a stage based
 *    on the preferred locations of its underlying RDDs, or the location of cached or shuffle data.
 *
 *  - Cleanup: all data structures are cleared when the running jobs that depend on them finish,
 *    to prevent memory leaks in a long-running application.
 *
 * To recover from failures, the same stage might need to run multiple times, which are called
 * "attempts". If the TaskScheduler reports that a task failed because a map output file from a
 * previous stage was lost, the DAGScheduler resubmits that lost stage. This is detected through a
 * CompletionEvent with FetchFailed, or an ExecutorLost event. The DAGScheduler will wait a small
 * amount of time to see whether other nodes or tasks fail, then resubmit TaskSets for any lost
 * stage(s) that compute the missing tasks. As part of this process, we might also have to create
 * Stage objects for old (finished) stages where we previously cleaned up the Stage object. Since
 * tasks from the old attempt of a stage could still be running, care must be taken to map any
 * events received in the correct Stage object.
 *
 * Here's a checklist to use when making or reviewing changes to this class:
 *
 *  - All data structures should be cleared when the jobs involving them end to avoid indefinite
 *    accumulation of state in long-running programs.
 *
 *  - When adding a new data structure, update `DAGSchedulerSuite.assertDataStructuresEmpty` to
 *    include the new structure. This will help to catch memory leaks.
